        <li>2 cups of mayonnaise</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon of ground paprika</li>
        <li>4 hamburger bun bottoms</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons minced onion, or to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Layer some of the sauce, 1 tablespoon minced onion, 2 tablespoons lettuce, and pickles on 2 bottom buns. Layer some of the sauce and remaining 1 tablespoon minced onion, 2 tablespoons lettuce, and American cheese on the other bottom buns.</li>
        <li>Season patties with salt and pepper. Cook in the hot skillet 2 at a time until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Place 1 patty over each bottom bun; stack and cover with top buns.</li>
